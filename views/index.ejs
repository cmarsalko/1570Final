      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>It's finals week as it always is. 10 projects are due along with 5 essays and 6 final exams. Trying to find a place to get work done, you walk all around campus, only to come up short. Hours wasted just walking when you could've been working. It's nearly impossible to find a place to study that's available. We wanted to create a solution to this problem. That's what led to Panther Planner's creation.</p>
